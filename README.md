Setup InstructionsFollow these steps to set up and run the API locally.Step 1: Clone the repository (if applicable)If you have already created the GitHub repository and cloned it, skip this step. Otherwise, first create your GitHub repository as per the challenge instructions.# Example: replace with your actual repo URL
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pizza-api-challenge.git
cd pizza-api-challenge
Step 2: Create a virtual environment and install packagesIt's recommended to use pipenv for dependency management.pipenv install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_migrate flask_restful
pipenv shell
Note: flask_restful is added for easier API development.Step 3: Run DB setup commandsSet the FLASK_APP environment variable and initialize the database.export FLASK_APP=server/app.py
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade
Step 4: Seed the databaseRun the seeding script to populate your database with initial data.python server/seed.py
Step 5: Run the Flask applicationflask run
